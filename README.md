# Detection-of-Malarial-Parasite-using-MATLAB

#ABSTRACT

This project uses image analysis studies aiming at automated diagnosis or screening of
malaria infection in microscope images of thin blood film smears. Malaria is a mosquito-borne
infectious disease of humans and other animals caused by parasites (a type of microorganism)
of the genus Plasmodium. Infection is initiated by a bite from an infected female mosquito,
which introduces the parasites via its saliva into the circulatory system, and ultimately to the
liver where they mature and reproduce. The disease causes symptoms that typically include
fever and headache, which in severe cases can progress to coma or death. Malaria is
widespread in tropical and subtropical regions in a broad band around the equator, including
much of Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and the Americas

#INTRODUCTION

Malaria is a mosquito borne disease caused by parasites of genus plasmodium. The person
gets affected by malaria when malaria parasites are introduced into circulatory system by
infected female anopheles mosquito bites. Approximately, 40% of the world’s population,
mostly those living in the world’s poorest countries, is at risk of malaria. A child dies of
malaria every 30 seconds. Every year, more than 500 million people become severely ill. With
malaria. Between 300 million and 500 million people in Africa, India, Southeast Asia, the
Middle East, the South Pacific, and Central and South America have the disease.

#GOAL

The biggest detraction of microscopy, namely its dependence on the skill, experience and
motivation of a human technician, is to be removed. The objective of the project is to develop
a fully automated image classification system to positively identify malaria parasites present in
thin blood smears, and differentiate the species. The algorithm generated will be helpful in the
area where the expert in microscopic analysis may not be available. It would also constitute a
diagnostic aid for the increasing number of cases of imported malaria in traditionally malariafree areas, where practitioners lack experience of the disease.
Input: Digitalised malaria blood smear image
Output: The count of total RBC and parasites infected cells.
